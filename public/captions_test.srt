1
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,569
Um So you don't need any tools today. It's

2
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,308
just gonna be us and our bodies and we're gonna

3
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,219
flow a little bit through the whole body. We'll

4
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:17,308
hit most of your systems today. Um And um

5
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,909
maybe we can really kind of focus on getting some

6
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,879
of that rotation back and, and also I think

7
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:27,149
what we'll do today is also gonna support a startle

8
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,028
reflex as well, which can all be protective response

9
00:02:31,038 --> 00:02:32,830
. So we've got, we've got a good,

10
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:37,069
I've got a good little flow plan today. So

11
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:44,899
let's start standing, sorry, love bug. I'm

12
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,909
sorry. OK. So let's start standing and since

13
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,939
we are standing hit with distance apart, mark this

14
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,129
part and we're gonna do a full body rotation to

15
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:58,319
do our assessment to start with. And of course

16
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,419
, if you want to do any of the others

17
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:02,270
feel free but have this spot mark so that,

18
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:04,849
you know, you can come back to it.

19
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,899
I like to point my fingers or do uh both

20
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:12,649
palms together and you just wanna do that full body

21
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,770
rotation kind of getting that marker of where you're at

22
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,360
where you're at today. And let's see if we

23
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,250
can we're on, I'm not going to assess after

24
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:28,210
every drill today. This is a flow. So

25
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:30,879
we'll only be assessing intermittently if at any point you

26
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,330
want to reassess something that we've done by all means

27
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:37,399
, you know, please do that. And so

28
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:39,699
we are gonna stay in this hip with distance apart

29
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,349
. This fine is gonna stay straight and we're going

30
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,139
to rotate the hips in a circle, almost creating

31
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:53,639
this hour glass figure with our shoulders and our hips

32
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:58,460
rotating the pelvis. Good. We're doing four in

33
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,750
each direction. So last one good and then let's

34
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:08,379
reverse. So from the side, your shoulders go

35
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:13,139
in opposition of your hips, straight spine kind of

36
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:17,000
pushing the hips forward, shoulders back. Last one

37
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:23,098
good, we'll come back to standing next, interlace

38
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:27,338
your hands behind your head. Shoulders in the periphery

39
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:29,807
, sit up nice and tall and give me a

40
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:32,608
little tuck of the chin and then lift through the

41
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:35,389
crown of the head. So you're really reaching an

42
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:39,937
opposition, be feel grounded on the mat, crown

43
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:43,449
of the head lengthens up. We're going to flex

44
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,048
over to the left and rotate flex and rotate.

45
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:53,910
Flex, rotate and then unwind and come all the

46
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,108
way up. Let's go to the other side.

47
00:04:56,119 --> 00:05:00,420
We flex a little rotate down, flex, rotate

48
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:05,059
, flex, rotate, let's come up and unwind

49
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:09,149
good. Now, release the right arm down,

50
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,309
left arm up and we're gonna do something kind of

51
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,329
similar this time, we're going to flex and open

52
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:21,170
up to the ceiling, flex, open, flex

53
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:30,209
, open, unwind and switch. So we rotate

54
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:38,928
, rotate and rotate and unwind. Good. Now

55
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,389
, give your low back a little bit of sensory

56
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,670
stimulus here, we're gonna start with our spine.

57
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:47,420
We're gonna start mobilizing and working with this thoracic spine

58
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:49,829
. And I think it's a good idea to give

59
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:54,670
yourself a little bit of sensory stimulus before we move

60
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:59,920
into anything lateral or anything in the thoracic. So

61
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:02,639
we're going to, if you have the opportunity,

62
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:05,439
you can back yourself up against a wall, you

63
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,259
don't have to. But the idea would be that

64
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:13,910
the hips stay still. They are not mobile.

65
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,988
OK. So either way you go through this,

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,988
just keep that in mind. So feed or hip

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,028
with distance apart, you're gonna laterally glide over to

68
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,809
the right. Selects the spine, rotate the shoulder

69
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:32,389
down, keeping the hips where they are sway over

70
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,980
to the side. We're gonna rotate open laterally flex

71
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:41,619
and then glide back into place. Let's go the

72
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:46,399
opposite way. So we glide flex, rotate,

73
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:53,309
sweep it around, then we un rotate or rotate

74
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,899
flex and then come back to neutral. Let's do

75
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,678
that one more time flex or glide flex, rotate

76
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:05,149
, sway around and doesn't have to be deep.

77
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,928
Remember, we're trying to keep our hips pinned up

78
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:12,540
against the wall. Last time on their side,

79
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:20,500
glide flex rotate, sweep it around and then come

80
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:24,920
back up and unwind. Good. Let's work a

81
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:28,298
little bit through some scapular mobility. So the arm

82
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:30,600
will extend out just directly in front of you.

83
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:33,639
Move it out to about a 45 degree angle.

84
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,738
And we're gonna begin by lifting the scapula up,

85
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:41,399
pulling it back, dropping it down, reaching it

86
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,660
forward, up, back down forward. Good start

87
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,959
to round that movement out, reach up and back

88
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,939
. I'd like to envision sort of a locomotive kind

89
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:59,500
of action in my shoulder here, Just the shoulder

90
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:01,720
is moving. Let's reverse that, pull it back

91
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,798
, lift it up, reach it forward, good

92
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:11,600
down, back up forward. So to just round

93
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:18,079
it up but two more, the last one and

94
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:24,660
release other side arm extends out to 45. We

95
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:31,459
lift up, pull back decom compress down and reach

96
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,830
so up, back down out good. Just start

97
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,619
rounding it out the more comfortable you get with it

98
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,700
can always keep the movement separate as you need to

99
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:48,359
last one and reverse. So we're reaching forward,

100
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:50,080
we're gonna pull it down and back and up.

101
00:08:52,529 --> 00:09:01,009
Good. Beautiful. That looks really nice y'all last

102
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,178
two and one watch for any tension, you start

103
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,529
to feel any tension on the other side of the

104
00:09:07,538 --> 00:09:09,649
body like, oh you're starting to grip on the

105
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:13,668
other side. That's gonna be an indication that there's

106
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:18,149
too much mobility happening. So just always being aware

107
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,019
of what the other side is doing when one side

108
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:24,849
is moving. So we're gonna mobilize through the ankles

109
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:28,149
and through the feet here by rolling onto one side

110
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:33,619
so that both soles of the feet uh are facing

111
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:35,580
the wall and then we roll through to the other

112
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,460
edge of the foot. Now, both soles of

113
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,820
the feet are reaching the others touching the other side

114
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,779
. So we just rolling through the ankle, exposing

115
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:48,019
the soles of the feet to the other side.

116
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:52,840
Good feeling that roll onto the sides, the full

117
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:58,678
foot placement and then rolling through but not pushing into

118
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,529
any pain or discomfort here. Good, breathing nice

119
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:07,788
and gently, we'll go a couple more each way

120
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:18,658
. Good. Last one and one beautiful shape that

121
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:22,969
out a little bit. And then let's reassess from

122
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:26,259
here before we go on to the mountain. Let's

123
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:31,219
see how we're doing, making sure that before we

124
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:35,000
go on any further. If there's any drills that

125
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,000
you need to do before we move to the map

126
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:43,158
to take your rotation up. If you have a

127
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:43,869
high reward, pay up that you do, then

128
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,450
go ahead and do that and you can meet me

129
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:54,609
on the mat in a comfortable seated position. So

130
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:56,788
we're gonna work on a little bit. Uh Let

131
00:10:56,798 --> 00:11:01,500
me see. Could you please call aside, you're

132
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:03,298
rotating? Oh, sorry about that, Vicky.

133
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:07,320
I'm sorry, y'all, I don't have the notes

134
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,639
are kind of far away. So at any point

135
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,649
, if you have any questions or you, if

136
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:15,399
I can do anything for you, please just go

137
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,019
on and put your speaker on if you have any

138
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:18,940
questions, I would, you won't be bothering me

139
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,609
or interrupting me at all. So let's come to

140
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:24,590
a seated position. We're gonna work on some spinal

141
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:28,139
mobility that thoracic spine once again. So you can

142
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:33,460
anchor your palms here on your knees and give your

143
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:37,950
sternum a little bit of sensory stimulus here because we

144
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,538
do use it as a cue when we move our

145
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:48,250
thoracic spine and anterior posterior position. Good. So

146
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:52,210
we are going to lengthen the spine, nice and

147
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:54,080
tall, gentle pull back of the chin and then

148
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,200
we're gonna lift the sternum up on a diagonal and

149
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:03,750
then pull it back, the shoulders stay fixed as

150
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:13,570
the spine glides back and forth, anchoring the shoulders

151
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,879
over the hips, gentle glide of the spine.

152
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,340
Good. Let's include our breath. Now. So

153
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:24,619
on the inhale, the sternum reaches up and on

154
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:28,330
the exhale, we pull the spine back. So

155
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,918
inhale, lift, exhale, pull good. Let's

156
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:35,250
add the eyes here. Inhale, the eyes go

157
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:39,428
up to the eyebrows, just the eyes are moving

158
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,070
as we pull the spine back, the gaze drops

159
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,259
to the cheek. So inhale, eyes lift to

160
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:50,038
the brow, exhale, we pull back and the

161
00:12:50,048 --> 00:13:01,250
gaze drops to the cheeks two more good. Last

162
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,729
one. And now we're gonna end in our inhale

163
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:09,109
, pushing the sternum forward and holding the gaze up

164
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:11,288
to the eyebrows in this fixed position for about 10

165
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:18,779
seconds. Just relax and breathe into this fixed position

166
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:28,149
. 4321 and release. So from here, we're

167
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:33,090
going to do a vertical smooth pursuit with the thumb

168
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,719
. So you've got your thumb in a comfortable position

169
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:39,639
out in front of your nose, maybe about 10

170
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,090
to 12 inches. We're gonna trace the, uh

171
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:46,259
, the thumb, the gaze goes up, we're

172
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:50,200
gonna shut the eye and bring the thumb back to

173
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,048
neutral. Open, track it up, just the

174
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:58,158
eyes are moving. So don't go too high,

175
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:01,038
shut the eyes back to neutral. Good. Few

176
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:07,899
more times looking up, tracking that gaze shut back

177
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:26,519
to neutral. Two more last one. Good.

178
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,830
Now we're gonna do a lateral glide from side to

179
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:39,219
side with that same thoracic spine good just being mindful

180
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:43,678
here. If the opposite hip begins to lift or

181
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,359
just being really mindful of the, of the movement

182
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,269
here in general, just don't pushing it too far

183
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,440
. Remember, you don't have to have a large

184
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,479
movement just a little bit. We want to be

185
00:14:56,489 --> 00:15:03,798
precise. Let's do two more either way. Good

186
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:09,250
. Last one and one and let's come back to

187
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:13,379
center. The next vision drill that we're gonna do

188
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:16,359
today is near far. So you can bring your

189
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:18,700
thumb back up in front of you, maybe even

190
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,379
a little closer this time, about six inches away

191
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:24,349
from the nose. And then you're gonna choose an

192
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,969
object, something that you can make contact with maybe

193
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:28,519
about 8 to 10 ft away. So we'll look

194
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,788
at our thumb, look away, look far,

195
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:35,769
come back to the thumb and find your gaze fixed

196
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:41,428
on something far and bring it back. We're far

197
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:52,149
near far, near two more. Go ahead and

198
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:56,090
release that and kind of shake that out or if

199
00:15:56,099 --> 00:16:00,038
you need to, you can always do a visual

200
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:03,580
reset here. If one of those drills felt like

201
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,928
it was pushing just a little bit. OK.

202
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,719
So here we are going to, I want you

203
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:12,918
to find your far away focus that you just used

204
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:15,658
in that near far drill. I want you to

205
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:18,109
fix your gaze upon it and begin to circle the

206
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:22,940
thoracic spine. So we're combining the posterior anterior with

207
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,330
the lateral good and let's use our breath as we

208
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,259
exhale the spine rounds back and as we put a

209
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:36,279
shit forward, we inhale good back, inhale,

210
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:41,599
lift, exhale, pull the spine back, beautiful

211
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,109
one more, holding that gaze and let's reverse,

212
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,529
exhale, pull back and lift on the inhale.

213
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:08,798
But sinking our breath with our movement. Last one

214
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:18,798
and coming back to center, release the right arm

215
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:23,828
down by your side and we are going to reach

216
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,847
the hand out laterally, flex the head in the

217
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:30,749
opposite direction. And with the left hand, we're

218
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,138
gonna start at the ox aut around the back and

219
00:17:33,148 --> 00:17:37,278
we're going to run three fingers down the S C

220
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:41,729
M into the collarbone good just going from the back

221
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:45,009
of the neck around that ropy next mus neck muscle

222
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:48,528
and into the collarbone. Good. Let's do that

223
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:55,250
two more times says the accessory nerve that runs through

224
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:56,239
that S C M and we're gonna do a little

225
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,289
accessory nerve glide nerve flossing here. So this right

226
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:06,630
arm is not, is now going to comp decompress

227
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,449
through the show through the scapula. So you're really

228
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:12,588
gonna press the scapula down, even pulling it back

229
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:17,568
towards the spine gently here, the fingertips can touch

230
00:18:17,578 --> 00:18:19,750
or the palm can be facing the floor, pull

231
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,189
the chin back in that lateral refle uh lateral flexion

232
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:26,779
and then like a chicken, there's a posterior anterior

233
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:32,779
glide of the cervical spine good, just giving that

234
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:37,828
accessory nerve a little bit of a glide and two

235
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,539
and one, hold the head back and pump the

236
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:48,299
scapula up and down. We're looking for about a

237
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,949
three out of 10 of intensity. So try not

238
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,868
to get too straining with it. Last two,

239
00:18:56,838 --> 00:19:02,588
last one good and release. Let's go to the

240
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:03,969
other side. So the left palm goes out,

241
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:08,939
fingertips are just reaching out for the floor flex the

242
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:14,410
neck away. And with your three fingers to come

243
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,140
back from the neck cross that Roy muscle into the

244
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,250
collarbone good, starting at like just below the occiput

245
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,880
, make sure you're breathing into a relaxed belly good

246
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:36,170
. And now we have our head flexed away.

247
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,348
I want you to press the shoulder blade down and

248
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:42,358
then pull it back towards the spine. Good.

249
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:45,660
Now, pull the chin back in that lateral,

250
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:51,818
lateral flexion and then we lift posterior anterior glide a

251
00:19:51,828 --> 00:19:56,358
little bit of a chicken ball. Good. Keeping

252
00:19:56,368 --> 00:20:06,858
that scapula decompressed too and one and release there good

253
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:07,229
. So from here, we're gonna move into a

254
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:12,739
shin box position, one of your legs will be

255
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:18,039
forward. I wanna hit the wall. So I'm

256
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:19,318
just gonna screw it up slightly here. Now,

257
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:23,380
you can use your hands for assistance here or you

258
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,039
can hold them up. But what we're gonna do

259
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:27,680
is move from shin box to shin box. Ok

260
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:36,469
? So both feet make contact and we're around and

261
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,930
then we go back the other way. One thing

262
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:41,729
that can happen here too, sometimes you can really

263
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:45,920
start traveling in the room. Actually, it was

264
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,680
kind of scooting around. So just try and always

265
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:52,098
come back to the place where we start and come

266
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:55,489
back. I am totally traveling as I say that

267
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:02,338
um and you can use your palms on the floor

268
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:03,539
for guidance. If that feels too heavy in the

269
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:07,789
hips, just pop your hands behind you. And

270
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:12,890
that will help you keep the spine from flexing too

271
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,949
much in this and for you getting too in more

272
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:18,328
of like rounded spine. We don't wanna do that

273
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:22,809
. We wanna keep the spine lifted as we work

274
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:29,049
through these hips good. We'll do this two more

275
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:38,729
times and the last one good coming back to center

276
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:42,150
and we are gonna pop back up to standing and

277
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:48,309
shake it out. A little bit. We are

278
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:52,039
gonna finish with some coordination and some activation for our

279
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:56,939
cerebellum. So what I want you to do is

280
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,348
bring your hands up, bring your fingers up me

281
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:06,989
, get closer so you can see me. Ok

282
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,289
? What this is gonna look like is pointer,

283
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:15,608
middle fourth, pinky, pinky fourth, middle pointer

284
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:19,170
pointer, middle fourth, pinky, pinky fourth,

285
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,650
middle pointer. Good. Can we speed that up

286
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:41,279
? Good. Can you shut your eyes? Uh

287
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:45,848
just breathing into a relaxed belly. Noticing if one

288
00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:48,818
hand, one finger is having a harder time?

289
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:56,680
Ok. Let's do one more round. Oh and

290
00:22:56,689 --> 00:23:03,559
shake that out. Good. And then let's reassess

291
00:23:03,568 --> 00:23:18,250
that. How's everybody doing after that cerebellum drill?

292
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:23,959
Are we good? Oh No, Lizzie. No

293
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,989
, do if that got you because it can be

294
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,588
activating just to another high reward payoff drill. Bring

295
00:23:33,598 --> 00:23:37,789
yourself back and let's go through some of that thoracic

296
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,868
mobilization now that we're standing so feed our hip with

297
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,539
distance apart and we're gonna begin that rounding circling the

298
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,489
rib cage around the pelvis. Remember the shoulders are

299
00:23:52,500 --> 00:24:00,588
fixed but inhale, exhale. Now this time with

300
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:03,229
the eyes, we're gonna move them in a circle

301
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:07,318
. So we're gonna, the, the eyes are

302
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:11,890
gonna follow the spine so they're gonna track up or

303
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:17,059
to the side around and up. Good. You

304
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:19,739
can maybe trace something in your room in front of

305
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:33,348
you that imaginary line and reverse. So stay with

306
00:24:33,358 --> 00:24:37,269
the breath, adding the eyes if that's too much

307
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:44,049
. You can shut the eyes and relax. Let's

308
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,640
step it out a little bit further here and we're

309
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,170
gonna rotate and palpate the palpate the rib cage and

310
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:59,000
the back as we move our arms around, just

311
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:06,239
getting a little bit more support and accessing our rotation

312
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:15,828
. Go ahead last two and one and one and

313
00:25:15,838 --> 00:25:19,949
we'll come back to standing. We're gonna move on

314
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:25,368
to some neck proprioceptive work by doing some neck bow

315
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,019
ties, which will start as bow ties with sharp

316
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,239
corners. And then just like we did with our

317
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,939
shoulder mobility, we're gonna just start rounding that out

318
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,618
the whole time, the nose and the face stay

319
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,049
forward. So, and I get closer so that

320
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:49,259
you can see my face so the nose will track

321
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:55,479
to the top right corner and down, up the

322
00:25:55,489 --> 00:26:00,140
45 to the left and down. Watch your rotation

323
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,199
here. It's very easy for the head to want

324
00:26:03,209 --> 00:26:07,019
to rotate so that you get more range of motion

325
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,338
, but it's not about how far we go.

326
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:17,250
It's about the precision. Just start rounding it out

327
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:33,269
. Beautiful. Last two, last one, come

328
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,309
to center and reverse. Uh, just going straight

329
00:26:38,318 --> 00:26:48,549
into that infinity. The neck beautiful last two,

330
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,309
last one back to neutral. And let's reassess our

331
00:26:57,318 --> 00:27:11,309
range of motion from here. How are we doing

332
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,608
? Good. Well, I see some good yawning

333
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:18,828
. So I'm feeling good about that. That's awesome

334
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:22,959
. Um The last thing that we, um,

335
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:27,348
are going to do today is, um, the

336
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:30,199
last thing that we are gonna do today is,

337
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:36,170
hm, I think we're kind of done. Actually

338
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:37,799
. I don't have anything back here. I thought

339
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:40,479
I had one more thing. I've got something on

340
00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:42,358
my mind that keeps running through, but as long

341
00:27:42,368 --> 00:27:44,699
as we're all feeling good, I think that might

342
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:47,199
be a good place to stop. How are we

343
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:49,930
all feeling, any thoughts or questions about what we

344
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:52,469
just did, Maria? Are you doing better now

345
00:27:53,598 --> 00:27:56,989
? Awesome. Awesome. And the short and sweet

346
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,689
today, I have a question. Sure. When

347
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:03,390
I do, well, a lot of that for

348
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,789
a lot of that, um, like I feel

349
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,118
nauseous, I always feel nausea. I don't always

350
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,459
feel nauseous when I do it. I instantly feel

351
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:15,588
nauseous. Um, but when I do my,

352
00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:18,489
um, like the assessments, they're always neutral,

353
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,338
they're not negative. Um, and especially nauseous if

354
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:23,309
it's like a part of my body, like my

355
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:26,789
right shoulder or my right foot that I've injured before

356
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:30,239
. Um, so I just kind of judge it

357
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,598
and, like, do it and then maybe do

358
00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:34,799
a high, like, step out and do a

359
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:38,189
high payoff drill. But is that what I should

360
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:41,549
be doing if I can? Not, just because

361
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,848
I think I judge it whether it's one of the

362
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:45,108
ones I should push through or not because I,

363
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:48,489
the eyes, I can't push through yet. But

364
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,469
, um, the other parts, yeah, I

365
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:56,670
would not push through nausea. I remember the concept

366
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,568
of what we do, we get better at.

367
00:28:57,709 --> 00:29:00,259
So we wouldn't want to push through pain, we

368
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:04,358
wouldn't wanna push through nausea. And so are you

369
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:07,559
, does that happen only on the right side where

370
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:10,500
there's injury or is that also happening as you go

371
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:12,529
through the left side as well? It happens,

372
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:17,299
um, with, well, mostly the right side

373
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:18,338
because all the injuries have been the right side.

374
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:22,400
Um, But it can happen like, um when

375
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,539
you're, when you're just talking like through the eye

376
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:26,759
drills because I can't, the eye drills totally set

377
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:27,160
me off. But when, if I'm just listening

378
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,709
to you doing them, um it at the beginning

379
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:33,489
of this class, it used to make me nauseous

380
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,459
and now I like can tell that I'm getting better

381
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:37,828
that I could listen to you doing them. Sometimes

382
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:40,469
I can even watch. Um So I feel like

383
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,500
, like I'm slowly working there, I can't do

384
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:44,539
them well, especially with contact thing because I'm on

385
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,009
a vision. But um but yeah, no,

386
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,140
the nausea can just be even hearing you talk about

387
00:29:51,229 --> 00:29:53,608
like doing something with some part of the body that

388
00:29:53,618 --> 00:29:56,769
obviously makes my body uncomfortable. Ok. Here's a

389
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:00,568
couple of things I would suggest as you're working with

390
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:02,568
the right side, I would treat the right side

391
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:04,469
and the left side, completely independent of each other

392
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:08,689
. And on the right side really be so small

393
00:30:08,699 --> 00:30:11,838
and maybe even visualize it instead of doing the drill

394
00:30:11,848 --> 00:30:15,630
at all, try and visualize the drill and see

395
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,410
if that would reassess positively because I, I y'all

396
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,930
would be surprised at how big of a high reward

397
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:25,449
you can get in a drill just by visualizing it

398
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,670
. So I would start there. And another thing

399
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,630
that I would do is, you know, if

400
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,890
the left side has its full range of motion and

401
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,430
say we're doing the scapula work and that's like feeling

402
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:37,549
really good. But on the right side, stop

403
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:42,019
and visualize and then reassess. Um and on the

404
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:45,750
vision stuff, you if if you are in a

405
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,250
visual reset like this and I'm describing vision work that

406
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:56,559
is um prompting nausea. Um No, like that's

407
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:57,858
getting better at the beginning of the course, there

408
00:30:57,868 --> 00:31:00,358
were certain things that I can't mm mm like I

409
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:03,439
couldn't do anything vision but now like, yeah,

410
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:07,449
I can listen to the vision stuff. Um and

411
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:08,828
I can watch now I can watch now some of

412
00:31:08,838 --> 00:31:11,640
it being done. I just um not all of

413
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,489
it. Sometimes I get nauseous but I just know

414
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,140
like anything where it's been any injury part of my

415
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,880
body, I instantly get nauseous when you even bring

416
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,818
up like um even with the like the scapula for

417
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:23,838
the left side, even though it's my right side

418
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,338
that I had reconstructive surgery on like, you know

419
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:29,979
, it's just I wonder what it would be like

420
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,858
if you laid down and visualized it. Oh,

421
00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:33,848
I'm gonna try that. That's, I think because

422
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:38,299
laying down is going to take stimulus away. Yeah

423
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,009
. No, that's a good idea. I like

424
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:41,299
that. I would try that. Try that and

425
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:44,189
let me know how that goes. I'd be interested

426
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,309
to hear that. Ok, because, yeah,

427
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:48,239
like, it's hard because I don't want to,

428
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,779
like, not come to the class. I mean

429
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:52,108
, I'm going to come to the class but,

430
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,108
like, then a lot of times I'm just OK

431
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:55,449
. Should I do it? Should I not if

432
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:57,358
I'm instantly nauseous? Yeah. No, instantly,

433
00:31:57,689 --> 00:32:01,640
no, I reward and then take it down,

434
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,259
take it down, take it down, take it

435
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:07,328
all the way down to the, like I said

436
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:09,670
, laying down and visualization. OK. Thank you

437
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,868
. Yeah, you're welcome. Thank you. Uh

438
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,390
I was gonna say um so all of this vision

439
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:22,618
respiration and vestibular training, all three of those I

440
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,910
had to start out like little baby steps, big

441
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:31,229
lessons for me in minimum effective dose. And you've

442
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:35,750
already had some experience Janine in, in getting better

443
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,809
and making progress. So you can see that those

444
00:32:37,818 --> 00:32:40,750
, you know, it doesn't matter how big your

445
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:45,209
step is, those baby steps will get you there

446
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,489
. It is. That's a good point. I

447
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,828
mean, honestly, because like even when we're talking

448
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:52,989
about thoracic glides and like I've been doing thoracic glides

449
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,390
my whole life basically, even before N si so

450
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,779
, you know, I the mechanics of it like

451
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:02,160
you don't right now, it probably doesn't even look

452
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,604
like my spine's moving very much. It's just a

453
00:33:05,614 --> 00:33:08,684
little right. And then eventually you get more range

454
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:12,693
of motion as you do it with precision. But

455
00:33:12,703 --> 00:33:15,525
it doesn't have to be large at all. And

456
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,285
it's like that with any of the drills. Right

457
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,384
. See, so I'm like circling my rib cage

458
00:33:20,394 --> 00:33:23,324
around my pelvis now. But it can be so

459
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:27,463
small, it can just be so small it with

460
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:30,404
any of the drills and you can honestly visualization is

461
00:33:30,414 --> 00:33:35,900
such a strong tool. I have a question.

462
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:42,019
Mhm We do the bow tie infinity with and show

463
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:45,799
me the head position. So your head position is

464
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:52,229
forward and just my nose is the tool. Imagine

465
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,930
if you had a marker, a crayon, a

466
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:59,019
pen, whatever you're gonna do and that's gonna trace

467
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:00,828
with the nose. So the nose goes up,

468
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:06,380
down, across and down. So there can be

469
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,510
, there can be a wanting to like see how

470
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,889
I'm like actually rotating my neck. My nose is

471
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,188
kind of going off to the side. That's what

472
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,168
we really want to be mindful of is that neck

473
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:24,619
rotation. So when I'm doing it, OK.

474
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:28,820
Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome, Cynthia,

475
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:36,500
you mentioned um laying down and I, I've,

476
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,840
I've been wanting to try some of that and,

477
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:42,510
and to lay down, but I realized that I

478
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:46,228
, I don't know how to um test laying down

479
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:49,449
. Yeah. And it, this thing with my

480
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,688
arm doesn't work. It like it doesn't, I

481
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:55,188
don't feel anything and if I was gonna lay down

482
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,148
and reas and assess it might look something like this

483
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:04,340
, I wanna make sure you can see me,

484
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:08,360
ok, your feet can be up like this or

485
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:10,949
they can be out whatever is the most comfortable for

486
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:13,530
your spine to be in. If I was gonna

487
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:15,389
do some of the vision drills or even the scapula

488
00:35:15,398 --> 00:35:19,070
stuff laying down, I would probably have my feet

489
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,949
planted on the floor instead of them being out like

490
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:23,869
this because that low spine, if, if you're

491
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:27,329
not in a neutral pelvis position, that low spine

492
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,300
can then um, maybe have a poor outcome.

493
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:38,188
But so you're saying, can you internally externally rotate

494
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:44,760
the shoulder? Yeah. Ok. So that would

495
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:47,659
be one, you could still do a abduction of

496
00:35:47,668 --> 00:35:55,000
the, of the shoulder. You could also do

497
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:06,489
neck rotation. What else could you do down here

498
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,889
? Hm. I think that seems to be it

499
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:13,929
. Oh, you could also assess what it's like

500
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,789
to have your arms overhead. I have a shoulder

501
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,860
injury on the right side. You could assess what

502
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:22,260
it's like to have your shoulders overhead. You could

503
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:23,958
do this one. Could you rotate your spine by

504
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:29,789
dropping your knees side to side? Well, this

505
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,829
would be more windshield wiper of the hips. Is

506
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,269
this what you mean? I was just wondering if

507
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,809
that's more like spinal rotation. I don't think this

508
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,159
is because this movement here. It, it is

509
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:44,000
happening a little bit in the low spine, but

510
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:47,369
a lot more is happening in my hips. I

511
00:36:47,378 --> 00:36:52,619
would think more of either the abduction, abduction,

512
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:58,110
internal external rotation, neck trying to think what,

513
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:00,019
what confused me is that, um, you know

514
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:04,929
, especially with my arm. When I'm standing up

515
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:07,438
, I can't really get it all the way down

516
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:09,458
and sometimes I can, I get a high payoff

517
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:13,878
and it'll come down when I'm laying down, everything's

518
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:15,639
good. Even my, you know, and I

519
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,489
have a lot of problem with my neck and when

520
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,378
I'm laying down and I turn, I hardly feel

521
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:23,059
anything. It might be that laying down is the

522
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,139
way that you should be doing some of the drills

523
00:37:25,148 --> 00:37:30,030
. If you're assessing better on the floor, then

524
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:37,378
standing, then I think you might want to take

525
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:43,280
more things down to the floor. Ok. Yeah

526
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:45,099
, because I deal with a lot of pain with

527
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:45,909
my neck, you know, just even turning my

528
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:50,458
neck, you know, it's doing this, it's

529
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,559
really painful and I'm like letting it be painful.

530
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:57,349
No, don't do that and assessing and assessing that

531
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,059
way. Oh, well, but there have been

532
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,139
times when it really lessened, you know, but

533
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:05,469
I, I shouldn't be going to that pain place

534
00:38:05,478 --> 00:38:07,820
. Huh? No, no. Just like I

535
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:08,500
was saying before, like, what we do we

536
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:13,829
get better at and what's happening is when the pain

537
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,719
is, um, triggered as the neural pathway that's

538
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:20,750
carved and then it's like, OK, that gets

539
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,059
triggered. I'm in pain and we keep using that

540
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:27,739
pathway, you're just, you're just making it a

541
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,978
better, easier pathway to get through because you're laying

542
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:32,958
more myelin down around the pathway, right? Like

543
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:36,719
that myelin is if you think of a wire,

544
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,800
right? And then the pathway of the neurons is

545
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:42,250
the wire and it's just like um and then you

546
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,750
have the plastic around the wire, the myelin is

547
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,809
what is going around that, those, that neural

548
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,280
network and it's just getting stronger, getting stronger,

549
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:54,454
getting every time you push through, it'd be the

550
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:58,175
same for uh Janine. If she was to push

551
00:38:58,184 --> 00:38:59,735
through nausea, it'd be like, oh trigger the

552
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:02,793
nausea. Oh She, she likes that. Let's

553
00:39:02,804 --> 00:39:05,894
just easy. It'd be easier to just trigger the

554
00:39:05,905 --> 00:39:07,454
nausea, trigger the nausea, trigger the pain because

555
00:39:07,465 --> 00:39:09,925
it gets to be a more well worn path because

556
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:14,224
it gets myelinated. So when you're not feeling pain

557
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:15,144
, what are you assessing when you do the,

558
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:20,559
the uh, reset the, uh, checking it

559
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,840
out? I've gotta keep forgetting that word. Well

560
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:24,090
, you could as, I mean, so you

561
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:28,789
assessing if it's not pain or not feeling pain or

562
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:30,659
is there anything that you do that is not painful

563
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,909
? An assessment that you do that doesn't cause you

564
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:37,659
pain. Well, even when I do this,

565
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:39,539
you know this, I only go to a place

566
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,208
where it, it hurts. Ok. Ok.

567
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:45,168
I know. I, so all of these things

568
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:47,849
, I'm assess. I'm in assessing pain is what

569
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,320
I'm doing. Yeah. Yeah. Ok. So

570
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:52,539
a couple of things that you could reassess would be

571
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:57,550
, your vocal tone could be, handwriting could be

572
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:00,760
balance. Like, do you know what your balance

573
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:04,139
is like to stand on one leg for 30 seconds

574
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:06,789
or to stand with the feet together or even to

575
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,438
put one in front of the other? And that's

576
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:10,909
hard. That's kind of hard. Yeah. Start

577
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:14,849
playing with one of those. Ok. Wow.

578
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,570
I guess it took me a long time to figure

579
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,679
this out. I hope I didn't go backwards.

580
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:22,099
No, you're not, you're catching it and,

581
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:22,628
uh, being aware of it, it's gonna be

582
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:27,340
ok, it's gonna be ok. Someone asked,

583
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:29,228
um, what does yawning mean? Yawning is a

584
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:38,159
beautiful release of the body and I wanna say now

585
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,179
and Cynthia, I wouldn't, I wouldn't worry so

586
00:40:42,188 --> 00:40:45,378
much about, you know, paint, like doing

587
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:46,780
things and, and taking a step back. I

588
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:49,978
mean, the bottom line is that it took us

589
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,280
years, some of us, well, me personally

590
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:57,659
, 68 years to get to this point. Um

591
00:40:57,668 --> 00:41:00,179
, a, a lot of things happening in that

592
00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:00,849
time. It, you know, this has been

593
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,610
a, we've all had a lifetime of, of

594
00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:09,059
injuries and, and various other issues in our bodies

595
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,360
. So it's not gonna, it doesn't just get

596
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,179
better overnight. It doesn't just go away. You

597
00:41:15,188 --> 00:41:20,840
have to reprogram your, your, your body and

598
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:22,628
your mind and your nervous system. And, and

599
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,199
it's a process but it's, it can be fun

600
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:27,699
if you just, if you look at it and

601
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:30,949
approach it with more, more curiosity, it,

602
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:36,500
it's not like I don't think of it as fixing

603
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,599
myself. I, I, I look at it

604
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,418
more as like, hm. Ok. What's it

605
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:42,699
doing now? How is it reacting to this?

606
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,628
Ok. You didn't like this. Let's try this

607
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:46,639
. Um, you know, and with without,

608
00:41:46,648 --> 00:41:51,938
without judging or, or moving into pain. That's

609
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:53,820
and this, this has been a big lesson for

610
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:59,449
me. I did not learn this overnight. So

611
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,449
and you can reassess your handwriting as you go through

612
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:04,208
this, you can keep a pen and paper next

613
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:06,989
to you. See what it's like to say there

614
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,438
are certain letters or numbers that I just don't,

615
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:09,978
I always feel like, oh man, that looks

616
00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:13,309
so bad. Like I can't write a cursive G

617
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,360
very well or something, right? And so what

618
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:19,849
does it look like as I move through this work

619
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,829
to try my cursive G? Yeah, I literally

620
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,070
anything can be a reassessment or you don't want to

621
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,820
go to pain. You don't wanna be reassessing pain

622
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:32,119
like oh, is that better? Less pain or

623
00:42:32,128 --> 00:42:36,929
more pain? Well, you can, you ok

624
00:42:36,938 --> 00:42:38,360
, I'm hearing a couple different things because like if

625
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:43,739
I show up with say maybe say I slept a

626
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,728
little bit wrong on my neck and I don't,

627
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:47,188
I'm not someone who normally feels pain in my neck

628
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,389
but it feels like, oh, there's a little

629
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:52,309
bit of a trick here. I might assess that

630
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,289
because I'm not usually in pain, but if I'm

631
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,550
doing something that always is causing pain and then I'm

632
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:02,769
continuing to assess that and I'm always just going to

633
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,289
, ok, let me just rotate till I find

634
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,050
pain. We're rotating till we find that, um

635
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:12,409
, that sort of, uh, oh, what's

636
00:43:12,418 --> 00:43:14,539
the word? Like the place that gets a little

637
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,668
bit? Um oh, what's the word I'm looking

638
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,590
for? Like a little bit stuck, you know

639
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,489
, but not pain. If this were to cause

640
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,030
me pain, I would not be reassessing and assessing

641
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,378
it. What's the word? Because you're gonna hit

642
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:32,208
a place in your rotation where you've hit your edge

643
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:39,628
but not if the edge causes pain when I'm realizing

644
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:43,250
that I've just been in, in pain. I

645
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,708
, and I would say this my mo my mother

646
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:46,648
and the doctors would tell my mother, I've never

647
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:51,599
seen anybody handle the pain like you do. You

648
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:52,969
have a strong, you know, and I,

649
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:55,458
and I think I do the same thing. I

650
00:43:55,469 --> 00:44:00,829
just ignore pain or work through it or whatever.

651
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:02,039
I, for a long time, it's like a

652
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,300
old pattern. So this is really different for me

653
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,648
to think about this, this way. Yeah.

654
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:10,378
Yeah. You're welcome. I'm gonna tell you,

655
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:15,458
I'm gonna bring up one other thing um for pain

656
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:17,668
to just kind of tell you about because pain in

657
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:22,039
general is, is an output of a nervous system

658
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,969
that is under too much stress, right? From

659
00:44:24,978 --> 00:44:28,349
a, from a neurological perspective, pain is an

660
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,360
output of your brain trying to get you to change

661
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,989
your behavior. When we have an acute injury,

662
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,398
there's pain and there's an action signal, right?

663
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:38,000
Something is wrong and you need to do something about

664
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,789
it. So like if we cut ourselves or burn

665
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,010
ourselves, we experience that pain. So we don't

666
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,039
go back to burning or cutting ourselves, right?

667
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,668
Like if you think about the burners on the stove

668
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:51,869
and you accidentally touch it, oh, I felt

669
00:44:51,878 --> 00:44:52,969
that pain, right. I'm not gonna do that

670
00:44:52,978 --> 00:44:57,110
again. It's the same thing with the signal in

671
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,389
your body because you don't want to keep doing the

672
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:04,469
pain. So sometimes there can be a biomechanical issue

673
00:45:04,478 --> 00:45:07,929
, like maybe there's tissue damage or o osteoarthritis in

674
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,898
the joint. However, when you get into those

675
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:14,898
long term chronic injuries, there's a lot of evidence

676
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:17,280
that shows that like we all have this degeneration,

677
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:21,519
meniscus tears in our knee arthritis in our joints and

678
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,648
it's normal that our bodies wear out over time and

679
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:28,659
wear down over time. But we don't all experience

680
00:45:28,668 --> 00:45:30,570
that same amount of pain. And that's because some

681
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:35,688
of us are experiencing less stress on a daily basis

682
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,128
. And when we have less stress, these other

683
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:40,409
biomechanical issues are not gonna be as threatening. Our

684
00:45:40,418 --> 00:45:43,719
brain isn't gonna be as worried about it. And

685
00:45:43,728 --> 00:45:45,449
pain is a really great tool when there's just too

686
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:50,199
much stress and when we're in pain, we do

687
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,418
less, we interact less with the world. We

688
00:45:52,429 --> 00:45:55,309
take smaller steps, we work out less or maybe

689
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,469
not as intense at all. And so we just

690
00:45:59,478 --> 00:46:02,219
really wanna be careful about like the stress level and

691
00:46:02,228 --> 00:46:07,449
the pain level and trying to find the thread um

692
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:09,938
, between these two, like, um, like

693
00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:13,878
, think of someone who has low back pain and

694
00:46:13,889 --> 00:46:15,349
also hates their job. Right. There's actually a

695
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,918
huge correlation between these two things. A lot of

696
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:22,239
people who hate their jobs also have, um,

697
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,458
low back pain. So if you are in that

698
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:28,360
pain and theoretically, you do less interact with the

699
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,360
world less if the job is stressful and your low

700
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:34,559
back already hurts and then you throw your back out

701
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:35,969
, then you don't have to go to work at

702
00:46:35,978 --> 00:46:37,800
all. You stay in bed, you rest and

703
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:39,929
your brain has kept you safe because you threw your

704
00:46:39,938 --> 00:46:43,489
back out. Right? You push through the person

705
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,090
pushes through the pain enough to actually injure themselves in

706
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:47,110
their back. And then what happens? Well,

707
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,340
it probably pain is gonna stop at some point because

708
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,800
you're not gonna have to go to work to the

709
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:52,648
job that you hate, that's causing the stress that's

710
00:46:52,659 --> 00:47:00,809
causing the pain. How does that feel? Yeah

711
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,949
. It, yeah, it, it seems like

712
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:04,800
I've heard it. I don't, I think in

713
00:47:04,809 --> 00:47:07,159
this class too that, uh, Melanie was saying

714
00:47:07,168 --> 00:47:09,688
something about studies that show that you, you know

715
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:14,128
, people have deteriorated, you know, arthritis in

716
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:16,519
their back and they do the MRI S and half

717
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:20,148
of those people do not feel pain and the other

718
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:22,050
half feel pain. It did. So it's not

719
00:47:22,378 --> 00:47:24,148
, it's not, I I'm, you know,

720
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,539
this is new to hear that. So, yeah

721
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,550
, I actually have stenosis in one of my uh

722
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,869
lower vertebra S L five S one, something like

723
00:47:34,878 --> 00:47:39,628
that really low. I never feel that pain,

724
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:44,329
like never. And stenosis is a literally choking out

725
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,760
of the nerve in the vertebra. I have a

726
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:51,148
friend who has the exact same thing and he is

727
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,820
always in pain. He has terrible O CD.

728
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:57,889
He's very activated all the time and he feels his

729
00:47:57,898 --> 00:47:59,478
back and I have the exact same thing. I

730
00:47:59,489 --> 00:48:01,909
never feel my spine. Never. It's very rare

731
00:48:01,918 --> 00:48:04,610
if I do. I'm like, oh shoot,

732
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:07,059
I'm stressed. What's going on here. I just

733
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:10,719
felt my back. Well, and I think we

734
00:48:10,728 --> 00:48:13,840
live in a, we live in a culture.

735
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,898
Um I was, I was always known for having

736
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:22,119
a, a very high pain tolerance and for years

737
00:48:22,378 --> 00:48:24,418
, um I wore it like a badge. Yeah

738
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:28,019
, me too. You know. Um And the

739
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,239
, the bottom line is that what I was,

740
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,139
what I was doing all of this time was simply

741
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:37,610
, you know, overriding what my body was trying

742
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:38,389
to tell me your body's talking to you. I

743
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:43,889
, I have personally found that the in Interception meditations

744
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:47,139
on the site have been very helpful for me because

745
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:50,579
I, I hear my body but I can't,

746
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,340
I would hear it but I would just keep,

747
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:53,478
I would just ignore it, push it down,

748
00:48:53,489 --> 00:48:57,438
push it down, ignore it. Keep going.

749
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:06,570
I be in acceptance me interception interception cept when,

750
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:08,269
uh, uh, well, she's there occasionally.

751
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,340
Those are done on Sundays, but I think Jennifer

752
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:13,668
, are there not some recordings on the, there's

753
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:15,309
gonna be audio recordings on the site where you can

754
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,639
find that, that where you can find that meditation

755
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,250
. And I would, I would lean into some

756
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,849
stress processing also. Like, I don't know what

757
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:27,019
your emotional processing is like, but I would lean

758
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,668
into that. I would really look into that.

759
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,090
Yeah, because sometimes you just can't drill your way

760
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:36,668
out of pain like you, it's, sometimes it's

761
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:39,030
not gonna be a drill that's gonna get you out

762
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,570
of pain. Sometimes it's gonna be emotional. Yeah

763
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,010
, I do a lot of emotional work, you

764
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:47,079
know, uh, about, since we, you

765
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:50,429
know, I've been doing it for years and I

766
00:49:50,438 --> 00:49:53,260
cry easily, you know, I can, I

767
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:57,699
can release a lot of stuff that way. But

768
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:00,500
, but, you know, so there's a lot

769
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:04,829
of emotional things going on with me but, but

770
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,628
I've come a long way too, you know,

771
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:08,148
I'm, it's like I'm here. Right. Yeah

772
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:09,458
. Absolutely. I mean, you know, it's

773
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:12,688
a journey like Susan said, like, we've been

774
00:50:12,699 --> 00:50:14,599
, just been at it for years. I mean

775
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,199
, I'm 74. I just, you know,

776
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:21,280
a lot of years there. Yeah. Yeah,

777
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,458
I think, yeah, when you think how long

778
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:25,458
it's been that you've been doing something that's gotten you

779
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:28,599
to hear, it's not just gonna be like,

780
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,039
oh, I've got some tools now, I've got

781
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,000
these drills and it's gonna be a shorter, it

782
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:35,469
could be, you know, it's gonna take some

783
00:50:35,478 --> 00:50:37,300
space as well. It's like that's the hard thing

784
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:42,668
about uh trauma and stories and narrative is that like

785
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:44,510
it happens like that, but it don't go away

786
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,070
like that. So it's just, there's all these

787
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,378
layers, just layers and layers and layers and layers

788
00:50:50,389 --> 00:50:52,898
, just peel, peeling back the onion, you

789
00:50:52,909 --> 00:50:55,579
know, totally and taking things really slow, really

790
00:50:55,590 --> 00:51:00,079
slow exercises, small and precise like, yeah,

791
00:51:00,378 --> 00:51:01,958
well, I can't get that in my head.

792
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:04,969
I wanna like go to the max, you know

793
00:51:06,478 --> 00:51:08,159
that when you used to doing that right back to

794
00:51:08,829 --> 00:51:12,119
that net work is like, oh no, I'm

795
00:51:12,128 --> 00:51:14,898
gonna do this. I am gonna do this even

796
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:16,110
if the pathway to do it is through pain.

797
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:19,688
So that push, push, push, which once

798
00:51:19,699 --> 00:51:22,188
again is always rewarded by society. You know,

799
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:30,079
the the the overperforming overdo is always rewarded and but

800
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:34,208
it doesn't reward ourselves. Who does that? Reward

801
00:51:34,478 --> 00:51:38,090
it? It's a heavy price. Got you and

802
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:43,719
women particularly. I mean, we've carried a lot

803
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:46,239
, we carry a lot. We've been driving for

804
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,478
hard, hard and fast for a long, long

805
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:52,458
time and a lot, uh, you know,

806
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:54,699
well, this is now gonna speak to rest and

807
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:58,469
slowing down, which can also feel really threatening when

808
00:51:58,478 --> 00:52:01,340
you're not used to doing that. So if,

809
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:04,260
if that, if you are one of those over

810
00:52:04,269 --> 00:52:05,708
drivers just doing, doing, doing, doing,

811
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:07,059
doing, doing, doing, doing, try and

812
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:09,639
slow the, doing down, you know, if

813
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:12,369
you're like, I always tell my clients like,

814
00:52:12,378 --> 00:52:15,099
if you're making a stew and you've got all these

815
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:16,418
vegetables that you need to wash, you know,

816
00:52:16,429 --> 00:52:20,869
get the potato. It's nice and slow. Let

817
00:52:20,878 --> 00:52:22,760
the water run over your hands. Feel the potato

818
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:25,978
. OK. Next boom. Get those carrots that

819
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:30,070
the eyes, feel the carrot, feel the water

820
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:30,889
. You know what I'm saying? Like really just

821
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:35,820
slowing little tiny things down because when we want to

822
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:37,840
make change, we don't have to go to the

823
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:40,750
max and expect that like, oh, it's,

824
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,530
it's through there. If I push hard enough.

825
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:45,079
Like if you think of throwing a pebble into a

826
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:49,668
pond into a lake, the tiniest pebble is gonna

827
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:51,688
make a ripple in the water. You don't have

828
00:52:51,699 --> 00:52:54,039
to get the massive stone to create the change in

829
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:58,219
that water. It's tiny. Wow, you're really

830
00:52:58,228 --> 00:53:00,320
speaking to me, you're really speaking to me.

831
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:01,648
I mean, I'm the fastest dishwasher. I'm the

832
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:05,179
fastest this, you know, uh and that's just

833
00:53:05,188 --> 00:53:07,750
like how my whole life has been because we just

834
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,860
everything's go, go, go and, and go

835
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:12,090
faster, faster, faster, run, hurry up

836
00:53:12,099 --> 00:53:13,780
, hurry up and then hurry up and then wait

837
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:15,469
, hurry up and wait. We do that so

838
00:53:15,478 --> 00:53:17,090
much. And, and I found that even just

839
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:21,280
little things like I, I noticed when I,

840
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:22,760
you know, after I shower because I have dry

841
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:23,329
skin and I, and I put lotion on it

842
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,469
and I would just, I'd get out and like

843
00:53:24,949 --> 00:53:27,889
in a hurry trying to get it all on and

844
00:53:27,969 --> 00:53:30,289
, and, and move on. And one day

845
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:31,050
when I got out of the shower, I was

846
00:53:31,059 --> 00:53:32,849
, I started to put lotion on and I just

847
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:37,079
, and just it came into my head how my

848
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:42,280
massage therapist touches my skin so lovingly and I thought

849
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,809
, why the hell am I not doing that for

850
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,188
me? And I started trying to just slow that

851
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:50,809
down, you know, oh and, and you

852
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,969
know, you just even just that sensory stimulus of

853
00:53:52,978 --> 00:53:54,469
, of, you know, and, and show

854
00:53:54,478 --> 00:53:58,728
your body some love which I was have not done

855
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:01,389
in a, in a long time. Um just

856
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:05,070
, you know, reacquainting yourself and, and falling

857
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:09,000
back in love with yourself, fall in love yourself

858
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:13,139
preaching Susan that is beautiful. I just love that

859
00:54:13,148 --> 00:54:15,579
so much sensory stimulus. Uh Cynthia might be a

860
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,438
really good idea for your neck or the places where

861
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:21,000
you do feel pain, find something that you like

862
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:23,554
the feel of. Some ladies use a jade roller

863
00:54:23,563 --> 00:54:25,675
. You could get a dry brush, you could

864
00:54:25,684 --> 00:54:29,333
use uh any side of a fork, right?

865
00:54:29,344 --> 00:54:30,405
The, the back side of the fork is gonna

866
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:34,215
be cool and smooth or you could use the,

867
00:54:34,224 --> 00:54:37,114
the tongs tis, what are those things called?

868
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,769
Just run, you know, find the stimulus that

869
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,070
feels good for you. Whether that's a silk cloth

870
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,398
or a cotton cloth or, you know, when

871
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:47,188
you take a shower, shut your eyes and start

872
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:50,530
feeling the water. Where is the water running over

873
00:54:50,539 --> 00:54:52,570
my body right now? Where is that? You

874
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:55,985
know, and just start cultivating that relationship with your

875
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:00,784
exteroceptive system, that sensory stimulus. And then also

876
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:04,164
like Susan, getting back to that interoceptive system and

877
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:07,394
slowing things down and instead of feeling like I'm gonna

878
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:09,655
get a reward for how fast I go, find

879
00:55:09,664 --> 00:55:12,804
a reward for how slow you go. Right.

880
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:15,333
There you go. Honestly, like, and I

881
00:55:15,344 --> 00:55:19,405
, and celebrating wins, celebrating the slowness. And

882
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:21,195
I mean, I'm someone who, when I,

883
00:55:21,204 --> 00:55:23,668
when I say set a goal or something I'm moving

884
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:28,599
towards, I get a literal present like I am

885
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:31,829
treating myself to something, whatever that is, you

886
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,260
know, it's like, OK, I'm gonna reach

887
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:36,909
this point and then what or hey, I'm halfway

888
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:37,458
there. What, what, how can I treat

889
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:40,539
myself? Look how good I've come. How good

890
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:44,989
can I be to myself? You know? Mhm

891
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:47,619
Thank you so much. You're welcome. You're welcome

892
00:55:47,628 --> 00:55:53,320
beginning. Yes. Yeah. And let's start working

893
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:57,559
on those reassessments and finding you something. Ok.

894
00:55:57,849 --> 00:56:01,250
Balance, balance sounds like it might be a good

895
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:06,208
idea. Yeah, I got a high payoff with

896
00:56:06,219 --> 00:56:08,809
doing those kind of drills too with closing your eyes

897
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,119
and put, you know, and it's real.

898
00:56:10,128 --> 00:56:15,179
It's not easy for me. Great, great.

899
00:56:15,188 --> 00:56:17,539
Thank you, Brenda. Thank you. Thanks y'all

00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:20,139

. Y'all too. Y'all are also very inspiring.

904

So thank you. Thank you. Bye.
