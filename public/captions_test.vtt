WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.269
Ok. So welcome everyone for another shortie. This

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.810
is Tuesday, July 18th, I believe. And

3
00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.929
today we're gonna be doing drills for the freeze response

4
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.569
. So, freeze response is a trauma response.

5
00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.929
When, um, you can think of like deer

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.068
in the headlights, you just freeze and then the

7
00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.250
body needs to decide. Do I go into fight

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.908
or flight? Get away from the danger or the

9
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.250
threat or do I go into maybe a flop where

10
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.959
I collapse and shut down and I may might dissociate

11
00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.450
, like separate myself from my body, um,

12
00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:40.408
separate from the surroundings kind of a disconnect. Um

13
00:00:40.418 --> 00:00:42.548
, do I go into full blown, overwhelmed?

14
00:00:43.158 --> 00:00:47.500
So today we're going to work on drills for dissociation

15
00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.908
and to help us get out of that freeze state

16
00:00:51.298 --> 00:00:53.539
? Ok. So, um, first things we're

17
00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:59.319
gonna do most of the stuff standing up. Um

18
00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.158
, so kind of the, the signs of freeze

19
00:01:03.168 --> 00:01:07.219
is, um, fast, heart rate, fast

20
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.359
respiration. You might lose that inability to our,

21
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.558
uh, to think and articulate. Um, you

22
00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:17.579
might lose some Abili like your throat constriction and it's

23
00:01:17.588 --> 00:01:19.939
really hard to talk. So let's go ahead and

24
00:01:19.948 --> 00:01:23.918
do an assessment. So whatever assessment you wanna do

25
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.900
whatever one works for you. I usually do a

26
00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:38.088
couple just to give me some variety. OK.

27
00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.069
So quick little set range of motion assessment. And

28
00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.269
then the first thing we're gonna do is this,

29
00:01:42.278 --> 00:01:46.150
we're gonna do a fairly quick sensory stimulation all over

30
00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.370
our body. So you can't see, but I

31
00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:49.838
have my foot up on something you can, you

32
00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:51.448
can, you can do this standing up, but

33
00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.338
I'm gonna give my foot some sensory simulation. I'm

34
00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:57.948
gonna go all the way my leg at that.

35
00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.849
Maybe give my other foot stimulation. Just kind of

36
00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.538
feeling my body like, uh this is where my

37
00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:13.149
body is all the way you can rub. You

38
00:02:13.157 --> 00:02:15.237
can pat if you have fingernails, you can do

39
00:02:15.247 --> 00:02:19.419
a little scratchy. I have no nails kind of

40
00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:23.199
rub the head. Ah, just kind of get

41
00:02:23.207 --> 00:02:25.818
into your body a little bit and then just for

42
00:02:25.828 --> 00:02:29.578
fun. Let's reassess that it was real quick,

43
00:02:29.588 --> 00:02:32.439
right? Maybe 30 seconds or so. Reassessed.

44
00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.960
Yeah. See if that changes anything that are you

45
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.149
? Yeah. Good. Great. Yeah. So

46
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.990
even with that, just real quick little stimulation,

47
00:02:44.808 --> 00:02:46.580
your brain liked it and gave you more range of

48
00:02:46.588 --> 00:02:51.300
emotion. All right. So we're going to start

49
00:02:52.558 --> 00:02:54.169
on the floor. We're gonna sit on the floor

50
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.899
. Um If you can, you can, we're

51
00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.520
gonna work with a beast. So if you're in

52
00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:01.409
a chair, you can do this sitting in the

53
00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.189
chair. Let me, yeah, let me demo

54
00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.050
it on the floor, but you can sit in

55
00:03:06.058 --> 00:03:08.770
the chair just with your foot extended. Mhm.

56
00:03:23.028 --> 00:03:25.939
Ok. And these are called foot waves. Ok

57
00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.319
. So we're just really going to give our feet

58
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.629
some, some love and attention. So I'm gonna

59
00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.080
start 1 ft at a time. I'm just gonna

60
00:03:35.088 --> 00:03:37.199
pull my ankle up, thinking of pulling my nose

61
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.879
to my, to my toes, to my nose

62
00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:43.240
. I'm gonna curl my toes and then I'm gonna

63
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.149
dive to like take a dive and then I'm gonna

64
00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.689
peel my toes back off the floor. Now you

65
00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:52.460
may get a cramp. That's OK. So curl

66
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.050
take a little dive, peel the toes back.

67
00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.088
So curl the toes, take a little dive,

68
00:04:00.338 --> 00:04:03.808
peel the toes back. We're doing this quite slowly

69
00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:10.099
. So curl take a little dive, peel the

70
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.860
toes back. Ok. Let's do the other foot

71
00:04:12.868 --> 00:04:15.300
. You can if you want to do both of

72
00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:15.869
these at the same time. But I think learn

73
00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.678
sometimes when we're learning these, it's a little bit

74
00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:21.119
easier. So I'm pulling my toes to my nose

75
00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:26.588
. Ok. I'm curling, I'm taking the foot

76
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.428
down almost to a point and then I'm uncurling the

77
00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.428
toes and peeling the foot back. So curling,

78
00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:42.048
diving, peeling back, curling, diving, peeling

79
00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:44.040
back, try to get a nice to fine one

80
00:04:44.048 --> 00:04:49.439
more curl, dive, peel back, great.

81
00:04:49.778 --> 00:04:53.459
Now we're gonna take that in the opposite direction.

82
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.939
So we're gonna start the same. So we're gonna

83
00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.509
start pulling do collection, pulling our toes to our

84
00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:00.540
nose. Now, this time we're going to pull

85
00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:03.449
our toes back. You can splay the toes like

86
00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:06.459
splay them open. I'm going to push with the

87
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.428
ball mount of my foot. See, my toes

88
00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.809
are still pulled back. Then I'm gonna curl my

89
00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.970
toes like there's a pencil on the floor and I'm

90
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.689
trying to pick it up and then I pull back

91
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.199
and then I open and slay, push with that

92
00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:26.470
ball out. Pick up the pencil with my toes

93
00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.928
all back. One more. Spray my toes,

94
00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.949
push the ball out, pick up with the pencil

95
00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:38.028
, pick the pencil up. I cannot talk today

96
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.230
and pull back right. So other side, so

97
00:05:43.238 --> 00:05:46.379
Dors flex, pull those toes up, spread them

98
00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.220
apart if you can. Cramping is a it,

99
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.738
it might happen. So that is just gonna lessen

100
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.488
up on the intensity. So I'm going to push

101
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.778
with the ball mount Barbie foot. The new Barbie

102
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.428
movie is coming out. So you have your Barbie

103
00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:01.069
foot maker go Barbie foot, pushing with the ball

104
00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:05.730
mount, curl, the toes, pull back,

105
00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:11.970
splay, push with the ball mount curl, pick

106
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.548
up the pencil, pull back one more. Push

107
00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:18.548
with the ball out. Curl, pick up the

108
00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:23.488
pencil, hold back. OK. Once again,

109
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.290
you can do these at the same time. So

110
00:06:25.298 --> 00:06:26.790
if I were to do them at the same time

111
00:06:26.798 --> 00:06:30.639
, I would just do that. I kind of

112
00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:32.470
like to do them separate in the beginning. So

113
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.858
because each foot is a little bit different. Ok

114
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.209
. All right. Let's go ahead and stand and

115
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.608
let's reassess that. And once again you can do

116
00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:48.028
this sitting. So if you wanted to do this

117
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.809
sitting, um, I would just do it in

118
00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:55.819
my, my foot, my heel, the foot

119
00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:57.798
on the floor, you can do it that way

120
00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:02.869
too. Ok. All righty. So let's go

121
00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:15.209
ahead and reassess. Oh, yes. My body

122
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.369
, my brain really like that. All right.

123
00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:18.199
So now we're gonna move on to the o so

124
00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:20.819
I move it, we're gonna do what we call

125
00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:26.838
cogs or sometimes called jumps. So you're just gonna

126
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.178
have your thumbs out in front of you, not

127
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:34.178
super far apart, not super in, but just

128
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:39.470
kind of maybe shoulder width and you're going to look

129
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.309
right, look left and you can have a pen

130
00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:46.338
or pencil, whatever this is, it's gonna be

131
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.459
your target and you wanna look at your target,

132
00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:51.480
focus on it and then jump your eyes to the

133
00:07:51.488 --> 00:07:57.959
other side without moving the head back and forth,

134
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:11.199
back and forth to a couple more. Good.

135
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.790
Let's take a nice big breath. Long, slow

136
00:08:13.798 --> 00:08:22.000
exhale, reassess, see how you did. And

137
00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:24.350
once again, if you get a negative assessment,

138
00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:28.149
meaning your range emotionally down or you had some sort

139
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.288
of a stress response like you started getting a little

140
00:08:31.298 --> 00:08:35.019
sweaty or you brought out some an anxiety that would

141
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:37.239
be considered a negative response. Go ahead and do

142
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.019
if you know, some high payoff drills, go

143
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.639
ahead and do a high payoff drill, excuse me

144
00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:46.639
, while I let my cat in. So my

145
00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:52.908
assistant teacher. Ok. All right. So let's

146
00:08:52.918 --> 00:08:56.538
move on to the next one. which is going

147
00:08:56.548 --> 00:08:58.879
to be what we call our chicken dance. So

148
00:08:58.889 --> 00:09:03.250
with the chicken dance, we are just stomping,

149
00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:07.450
stomping our feet and we add our wings and we

150
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:13.090
want to actually whack our ribs or just saying,

151
00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:16.979
whack our ribs with our elbows. Ok? You

152
00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.359
can walk around, you can stay in place.

153
00:09:20.119 --> 00:09:20.989
So this is the motion and then we add our

154
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.058
breath to it. So we're gonna breathe in and

155
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:37.609
out through the nose. It looks silly and it's

156
00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:41.090
really important that you make the contact with the ribs

157
00:09:41.099 --> 00:09:43.320
and really give your ribs a good whack not to

158
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.359
where it hurts. But we want to, we

159
00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:54.788
want to engage those ribs and bones and then relax

160
00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:11.940
, reassess. Ok. Great. And then the

161
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.719
last one for today, we're breaking this up into

162
00:10:15.729 --> 00:10:16.649
two days like we always do. The no short

163
00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:20.590
days are Tuesday and third on Friday. And they're

164
00:10:20.599 --> 00:10:22.129
the same theme. So the last one for today

165
00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.548
, I don't know what it's called. I called

166
00:10:24.558 --> 00:10:26.719
it the micro, you know, the slim had

167
00:10:26.729 --> 00:10:31.450
those really long arms before he jumped in the pool

168
00:10:33.609 --> 00:10:37.288
. We would do this. So this kind of

169
00:10:37.298 --> 00:10:39.369
this rotation once again, you want to slack,

170
00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:46.969
those, slap your body with your arms because we're

171
00:10:46.979 --> 00:11:03.090
trying to create more sensory awareness. You can also

172
00:11:03.099 --> 00:11:05.859
, if you wanted to with this and with the

173
00:11:05.869 --> 00:11:09.710
chicken dance, do a little toning, like make

174
00:11:09.719 --> 00:11:11.979
some noise in your throat. You can just be

175
00:11:11.989 --> 00:11:22.989
like a uh get that vocal going. Um do

176
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.259
some humming things like that to kind of activate the

177
00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:33.788
vocal chords. All right. So let's go ahead

178
00:11:33.798 --> 00:11:39.469
and reassess after your nice big inhale and exhale.

179
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:54.219
Great and see how you feel. I feel calmer

180
00:11:54.229 --> 00:11:56.719
, yet more energized after doing that, I feel

181
00:11:56.729 --> 00:11:58.619
much more balanced. I feel much more in my

182
00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:03.099
body. Um Yeah. So that was great.

183
00:12:03.109 --> 00:12:07.058
So that's what we're doing for today. The freeze

184
00:12:07.308 --> 00:12:11.788
um come in Friday or jump on Friday and we're

185
00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:16.500
gonna do some more um drills for the freeze response

186
00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:18.960
. Ok. So I'm gonna go ahead and stop

187
00:12:18.969 --> 00:12:22.908
the recording. Oh, and we'll see y'all on
